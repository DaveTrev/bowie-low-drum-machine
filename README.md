## Javascript Drum Machine (Bowie - low album style drum samples curtosy of reverb.com)


## Notes
- Project inspired by and guided by javascript30.com
- Drum samples from https://reverb.com/software/samples-and-loops/reverb/3798-drums-in-the-style-of-david-bowie-s-low
- to give the keyboard keys number inputs, I used https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html
- picked the google font "Fragment Mono" to give a more 70's digital look and picked the font "climate crisis" to get a font closer in style to the "blippo" and "pump" styles used on the cover of the Bowie album "Low" https://fontsinuse.com/uses/14695/david-bowie-low-album-art
- using a hex colour chart to get closer to the look of the "Low" album color tones https://colorswall.com/palette/93325
